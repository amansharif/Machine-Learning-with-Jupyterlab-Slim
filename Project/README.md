## Tips and Tricks
The base image is python version 3.7.9. However I did that because I felt suitable. If you want some other base image, you don't need to research again. You can just leverage the --build-arg flag during docker build.

```docker build --build-arg BASE_CONTAINER=<Your preferred base image> -t <your preferred tag> .```
